    1. If the type of f is a -> a -> a -> a, and the type of x is Char, then
    the type of f x is:

    a) Char -> Char -> Char

    2. If the type of g is a -> b -> c -> b, then the type of
    g 0 'c' "woot" is:

    d) Char 

    3. If the type of h is (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b, then the type of
    h 1.0 2 is:

    d) Num b => b 

    4. If the type of h is (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b, then the type of
    h 1 (5.5 :: Double) is:

    c) Double

    5. If the type of jackal is (Ord a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a, then the type
    of jackal "keyboard" "has the word jackal in it" is:

    a) [Char]

    6. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the
    type of kessel 1 2 is:

    d) (Num a, Ord a) => a

    7. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the
    type of kessel 1 (2 :: Integer) is:

    a) (Ord a, Num a) => a

    8. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the
    type of kessel (1 :: Integer) 2 is:

    a) Integer
